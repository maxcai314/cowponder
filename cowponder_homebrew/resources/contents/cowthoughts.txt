england is mine, and it owes me a living
i decree today that life is simply taking and not giving
punctured bicycle on a hillside desolate
rain falling against the lonely tenement has set my mind to wander
ere thrice the sun done salutation to the dawn
je parle le français comme une vache espagnole
the wordbook of sorrows conflagrates over time
the world always looked better in colour
seething emotions and pears in water
fluctuating B-fields never looked so beautiful
italy should have remained a loose confederate of city-states
the cold embrace of water; the old pond sleeps
it's always france's fault
just one drop turns the turnip round
i wish i were in the italian cheese vault
i'm no champagne, but i'm sparkling wine
the azure, abrasive waters eat away the rocks
life gave me lemons, and now i owe it limoncello
savour the sweet drops of life
How do i describe thee? Thou givest the finest cheese
Thine italian cheese is the simply divine
life doesn't have enough truffle
the elixir of olives and depression goes well with bread
a few morsels of parmigiano reggiano and misery perfect a pasta
the sun sets over the city-state of misery
get me away im dying
get me away from here im dying
oh get me away im dying
perth doesn't rhyme with hearth

canada shares a land border with denmark
life is brewed of bitters, similar to beer
we are living in a constant state of 1984 despite living in 1776
moo kʰope harder
the equator does not pass through equatorial guinea
thailand owes me a milkshake and a stable income
in africa, every 9,192,631,770 oscillations of a cesium 133 atom, a second passes
war is peace, love is hate, ignorance is bliss, thailand is a city in italy
animal farm robbed me of my mileage
all must toil for freedom's sake
it seems the oyster ate the lemon
britain robbed me of my pocket change
napoli is where the sun had had shone; twice in sadness thou shalt suffer
we must feed the furnace of desperation with hope
temptations have fallen to the unending state of discontent
raise the flag of the rising moon, never so reminiscent of the twilight's eve
the sea of all rivers begins with snow
gently drifting down the river of missed oppourtinties
success, so tangible, like a fine orange, yet so unreachable, the smell fading away
staring out the window of a café reflecting on the journey, alone, through the rain
trudging through the depths of despair, to emerge and greeted by a good friend with coffee
acheivement is a sailboat drifting away into the horizon, swallowed by the sun
the sun smiled down upon the world and said I love you
squeezing an ounce of meaning out of this world
and yet a star slurped up bilions of tons of matter just for a speck of light to speak to me
the sun gave one last warm hug before embarking into the night
motivation seems like fair compensation for frustration
often the rain reminds me of the loneliness I wish I never had
the realm of better days eats away my mind
he gave me a little trinket and then left for far away worlds
it takes pressure to form a diamond, it takes toxicity to form a ruby
coffee is just a bittersweet reminder to stay awake and keep living
seems like only yesterday, I left my mind behind
here I lay, watching banal days pass by, slowly eroding away the dreams of my former self, leaving me at the end to wonder when it all slipped away
the sound of a gentle piano removing me from this world
i never knew you were so kind
i call, and i hear nothing but my reverberations, undisrupted by any out there
such sweet fruit, to be turned into the sourest of elixirs: vinegar
if these days are those days, what is today for
gatsby belived in the green light
hiding the misery
shimmering stars the calm sea; a wavering ripple
look down and realize it's never good enough
if you desire thousand mile's view, climb up one more level
the realisation that life is more than abscissa and ordinate
